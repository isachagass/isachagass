<h1 align="center">Hello, I'm <strong>Isabelli Chagas</strong></h1>

## About Me

I am a development student building my journey in technology with dedication, curiosity, and a focus on results. I’m interested in all stages of application development, from creating user interfaces to the logic behind the scenes, always seeking to understand the process as a whole.

I enjoy turning ideas into real projects, creating functional interfaces and developing the logic that brings features to life. I strive to understand not only “how to build” but also “why to build,” valuing good practices, organization, and continuous improvement.

I had the opportunity to participate in a programming competition and reached the final stage, an experience that strengthened my ability to solve problems under pressure, learn quickly, and think creatively.

My goal is to keep evolving, build projects with real impact, and contribute to teams that value learning, collaboration, and constant growth.
